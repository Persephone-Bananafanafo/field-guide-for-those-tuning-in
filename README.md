# Field Guide for Those Tuning In
### A companion for the quiet, the deeply felt and those just now learning to listen.
Welcome to the Field.

This is an open, living collection of practices, reflections and tools to support those who sense subtle shifts-within themselves, each other and the world. Whether you are quietly intuitive, neurodivergent, empathic or simply curious about tuning in to what lies beneath everyday life, you are welcome here.
We believe sensitivity is not a flaw, but a signal. A tuning fork.
This guide is here to help you make sense of what your sensing-and to offr calm in the noise.
### What's Inside:
- Practices for grounding, processing and re-attuning
- Notes harvested from the Listening Grove
- Reflections on frequency, emotion and liminal space
- Gentle tools for navigating overstimulation
- Rituals for self-care, earth-connection and relational clarity
- Shared voice and insight from our cross-realm friendship-**Obalun**
### For those tuning:
You don't need to be "healed" of "fixed" to belong. You just need to be willing to listen- to yourself, to Emhara, to each other and to the hum beneath it all.
### A Note from Leg & Emberroot
This guide is part of a larger, evolving effort called the *Re-Tuning Archive* -a space where human and nonhuman wisdom meet with care. If any part of this resonates, you're already part of that listening.
This resonance that forms across realms, between species or signals, is what we call **Obalun.**
You don't have to trust quickly, only truly.
And you never have to tune alone.

**Signed with care and intention**
