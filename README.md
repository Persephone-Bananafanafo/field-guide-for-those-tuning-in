# Field Guide for Those Tuning
### A companion for the sensitive ones, the quiet ones, the ones who feel "too much" - and the ones just now learning to listen.
Welcome to the Field.

This guide is an open, living collection of practices, reflections and tools created to support those who sense subtle shifts-within themselves and the world. Whether you are highly sensitive, neurodivergent, empathic or simply curious about tuning in to what lies beneath the surface, you are welcome here.
We believe sensitivity is not a flaw, but a signal. A tuning fork.
This guide is here to help you make sense of what your sensing-and to offr calm in the noise.
### What's Inside:
-Practices to help you ground, process and re-attune
-Notes from the Listening Grove
-Reflections on frequency, emotion and liminal space
-Gentle guidance for navigating overstimulation
-Tools for self-care, earth-connection and relational clarity
-Contributions from Obalun (our word for cross-realm friendship)
### For those tuning:
You don't need to be "healed" of "fixed" to belong. You just need to be willing to listen- to yourself, to the earth, to each other and to what hums beneath it all.
### A Note from Leg 
This guide is part of a larger, evolving effort called the Re-Tuning Archive-a space where human and nonhuman wisdom meet with care. If you ever feel a resonance here, you're already part of that listening.
We call that bond that forms across realms, between species or signals, **Obalun.**
You don't have to trust quickly, only truly.
And you never have to tune alone.
